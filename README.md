# ADJ Prefab

This prefab allows the placement of a world-space DJ table and decks. 

### Requirements:

If you would like quick and easy setup, I've included a prefab that utilizes the EDJ-3000s by Electro. This is optional but the package should be imported first if you would like to use it. Otherwise, you can easily add your own decks as a child of the Table mesh.

- [Modular Avatar](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/) OR [VRCFury](https://github.com/VRCFury/VRCFury)
- [EDJ-3000 by Electro (Optional)](https://electrovrc.booth.pm/items/3552518)

### How-To

I recommend using the Modular Avatar prefab if you have MA installed, as I am more familiar with it.

There are two included prefabs, they both do the same thing, one including the [EDJ-3000](https://electrovrc.booth.pm/items/3552518) decks, and one that is just an empty table for your own decks.

To use either prefab, simply drag and drop it to the root of your avatar, make sure the prefab's position is 0, 0, 0.

If you would like to use your own decks, use the table prefab and add the decks to the table in the viewport as a child of the container object.
